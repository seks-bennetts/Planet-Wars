<p>&ldquo;Oo oooh!&rdquo; &ldquo;This is gonna be the best day of my life! My liife!&rdquo; a little girl sang jumping and rolling down a hill.<br>
&ldquo;Oh! Ice cream stand!&rdquo; she said.<br>
&ldquo;Ice cream! Ice cream! Come get your ice cream!&rdquo; said a big boomy voice.<br>
&ldquo;Um sir? How much does this cost?&rdquo; Carel asked.<br>
&ldquo;Not too much for you. On the house.&rdquo; said the man.<br>
&ldquo;?&rdquo;&hellip; &ldquo;thanks?&rdquo;&hellip;&ldquo;thanks!&rdquo; Carel said, grabbing the ice cream.<br>
&ldquo;Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay&rdquo; screamed the girl running to her tree fort. She dove behind a tree trying to look secretive. She climbed up her secret ladder and into it.<br>
&ldquo;Ok, who&rsquo;s hungry?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Chirp! Gulp! Cricket!&rdquo; The animals called.<br>
&ldquo;Well, nice to know I at least have some friends.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Well, I’m going to go for a run, bye!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Qwerty, Grub, Mugl!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Wee!!&rdquo; She said hopping down from the treehouse, &ldquo;Someday I&rsquo;m gonna break an arm doing that!&rdquo; And she ran right into the forest.</p>

<p>They raced up to the outlaws by the dam just in time before they set it off.<br>
These were the most popular villains: Boost,Turbo, and weirdest of all Fantom, and&hellip;and&hellip;we don’t know his name yet; but they must  have been from another planet. One of them died when someone shot him or so they say.<br>
They just stared at each other for a long time, &ldquo;Stand down or go through us!&rdquo; Jett said.<br>
&ldquo;Haha you can try.&rdquo; one said pulling a pistol out of his satchel. Then raising the pistol up to Dash.<br>
His Father’s eyes widened finally he took a deep sigh and said &ldquo;What do you want, because this isn&rsquo;t the way to get it.&rdquo;<br>
Then the outlaws spoke &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, this ain&rsquo;t the way&hellip;  you&rsquo;re the way.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;You can get us gold can’t you? Or the kid goes by-by, your choice.&rdquo; the same man said. The man had a very strong accent, he must have been Boost the leader.<br>
&ldquo;Fine, if you want gold why blow up the dam?&rdquo; Jett said. Right then the man or girl-the girl was younger then the others-she raised the pistol and stopped at Jett.<br>
Dash raced over to his Dad and dove into him knocking him behind the speedcar as the bullet went past them.<br>
&ldquo;Attack!!&rdquo; one of the men shouted. The men and some women fought and fought and fought.</p>
<p>But then someone in the trees blew the dam and all was lost.</p>

<p>He zipped across the flat, steaming land, testing a new speed car.<br>
&ldquo;Ok, already see you on the next round.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Aye-aye, captain&rdquo; said a tall man in a beige tuxedo, as the crew split.<br>
&ldquo;Dad!&rdquo; The same boy called out, surprised and happy. He ripped off his helmet and turned the notch down so                       the engine wouldn’t burn, then jumped out of the car and raced right into his Dad’s arms.<br>
&ldquo;Welcome back, Jett,&rdquo; another man said.<br>
&ldquo;Glad to be back.&rdquo; Jett said, &ldquo;So, how is the new speed car doing, Dash?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh, it’s doing great&rdquo; he gleamed happily into his father’s eyes.<br>
&ldquo;Awesome,&rdquo; Jett said.<br>
&ldquo;Um, Sir, a messenger reported he saw outlaws putting blasting barrels by the dam, Sir&rdquo;.<br>
&ldquo;Oh no, this is bad.  There&rsquo;s no time for tests now.  Son, do you think the cars will work?&rdquo; Jett asked?<br>
&ldquo;Um &hellip;yes?&rdquo; Dash said. &ldquo;I think they will work.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I know they will work!&rdquo; said his Father.<br>
<em>&ldquo;That sounded proud&rdquo;</em> Dash thought happily.&quot;<br>
&ldquo;You two get the pistols, you wait here for them and the rest of you men&hellip; prepare for battle.&rdquo; Jett said.<br>
&ldquo;Um? Dad, what do I do?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Didn’t you hear me? I said the rest of you men get ready for battle.&rdquo;</p>

She ran to the big birch tree, turned left and there it was. The tree fort looked more impressive than last time. They improved.<br>
&ldquo;HEY! Flitttter!&rdquo;<br>
Flitter looked around. &ldquo;Oh hey,!&rdquo;<br>

<p>“Excuse me, Mother.”<br>
“Yes?” a queenly voice said, “What is it?”<br>
“May I take a stroll, please” said the young child.<br>
“Yes, of course, my dear.” said the mother.
She walked outside the door. Once the door closed, she began to run. She hopped off the floating island and jumped onto a smaller one. This island had a little tree that arched over to form a doorway. She reached into one of the branches and pulled some clothes out. Quickly, she pulled off her top layer of clothes to reveal a leotard underneath and changed behind the tree.</p>
<p>And then, she jumped off the last island&hellip;</p>

&ldquo;What was her name again? OH RIGHT!!! PEARY!! But I thought I knew everybody in the jungle. Ok, maybe not evvvvverybody.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Princess Sparrow! Prince Hickory!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said Sparrow calmly and quietly, but loud enough to be heard from the other branch.<br>
&ldquo;WHAAAAAAAAAAT?&rdquo; Hickory yelled impatiently, &ldquo;Geez, I want to fire that guy.&rdquo; Hickory whispered to Mink.<br>
&ldquo;Not if I can help it when I’m queen&rdquo;, Sparrow said bossily stratniny up.<br>
Sparrow apparently heard it; Hickory rolled his eyes, &ldquo;Your father wants you for something!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Do you know what?&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Nooo,I don&rsquo;t, he told me not to ask!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Oh, ok.&rdquo; Sparrow said.<br>
&ldquo;Do you think it is about mother? D-do you think you’re becoming Queen?&rdquo; Hickory asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sparrow, you&rsquo;re going too FAAAST!&rdquo; Mink complained.<br>
&ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;ll slow down.&rdquo; Sparrow replied.<br>
&ldquo;Want to race?&rdquo; Mink challenged.<br>
&ldquo;Umm? Not really. You just asked me to slow down.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Mmh, Bla-Bla-Bla&rdquo; Mink grumbled under his breath.<br>
&ldquo;I heard that.&rdquo;, Sparrow said, rolling her eyes.<br>
&ldquo;Yeah, yeah,&rdquo; Mink groaned.</p>

<p>Sprout hopped off a branch and out of the tree. &ldquo;<strong>SPROOOOOOON!</strong>&rdquo; she shouted, &ldquo;COME OOOOON!&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;I’m coming,&rdquo; a soft voice said from a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daisy will be waiting for us&rdquo; Sprout said impatiently. &ldquo;UHG…&rdquo; Sprout had an idea. &ldquo;<strong>RACE YOOOU!</strong>&rdquo;, she screamed as loud as she could.<br>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so loud, someone will hear us.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;YOU DON’T KNOW THAT ANYMORE! Other planets don’t sneak onto other planets anymore now tha-&rdquo; When she heard no answer, she pivoted toward where Sproon used to be.  She was gone.<br>
&ldquo;Uhhh, Sproon? <strong>SPROON?!</strong> Did she go ahead? Yeah, yeah, she must have gone ahead&hellip;right?&rdquo;<br>
&hellip; Aah!!  Then the only thing left there&hellip;was silence.</p>
