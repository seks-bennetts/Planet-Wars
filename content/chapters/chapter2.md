## Sparrow's Life - New kid
---

Two kids walked up. "Hey guys!" Mink said.  
"Mink! Sparrow!" Hickory said. "**SPARROW!!!**"  
"Who is that with you?" Sparrow asked.  
"Oh, her? This is my friend Peary. Peary, meet Mink and Sparrow."  
"Mink, Sparrow, Peary" Hickory said.  
"Oh hello" said Mink.  
"Hi," Sparrow said.
"H-hi" she said softly and slowly. 
"What was her name again? OH RIGHT!!! PEARY!! But I thought I knew everybody in the jungle. Ok, maybe not evvvvverybody."  
"Princess Sparrow! Prince Hickory!"  
"Yes?" said Sparrow calmly and quietly, but loud enough to be heard from the other branch.  
"WHAAAAAAAAAAT?" Hickory yelled impatiently, "Geez, I want to fire that guy." Hickory whispered to Mink.  
"Not if I can help it when I’m queen", Sparrow said bossily stratniny up.  
Sparrow apparently heard it; Hickory rolled his eyes, "Your father wants you for something!"  
"Do you know what?"  
"Nooo,I don't, he told me not to ask!"  
"Oh, ok." Sparrow said.   
"Do you think it is about mother? D-do you think you’re becoming Queen?" Hickory asked.
