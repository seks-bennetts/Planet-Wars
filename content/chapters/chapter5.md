## Dash's Life - Family Reunion
---
He zipped across the flat, steaming land, testing a new speed car.  
"Ok, already see you on the next round."  
"Aye-aye, captain" said a tall man in a beige tuxedo, as the crew split.  
"Dad!" The same boy called out, surprised and happy. He ripped off his helmet and turned the notch down so                       the engine wouldn’t burn, then jumped out of the car and raced right into his Dad’s arms.  
"Welcome back, Jett," another man said.  
"Glad to be back." Jett said, "So, how is the new speed car doing, Dash?"  
"Oh, it’s doing great" he gleamed happily into his father’s eyes.  
"Awesome," Jett said.  
"Um, Sir, a messenger reported he saw outlaws putting blasting barrels by the dam, Sir".  
"Oh no, this is bad.  There's no time for tests now.  Son, do you think the cars will work?" Jett asked?  
"Um ...yes?" Dash said. "I think they will work."  
"I know they will work!" said his Father.  
*"That sounded proud"* Dash thought happily."  
"You two get the pistols, you wait here for them and the rest of you men... prepare for battle." Jett said.  
"Um? Dad, what do I do?"  
"Didn’t you hear me? I said the rest of you men get ready for battle."
