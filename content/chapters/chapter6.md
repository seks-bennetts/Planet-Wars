## Dash's Life - Speed Fight
---

They raced up to the outlaws by the dam just in time before they set it off.  
These were the most popular villains: Boost,Turbo, and weirdest of all Fantom, and...and...we don’t know his name yet; but they must  have been from another planet. One of them died when someone shot him or so they say.  
They just stared at each other for a long time, "Stand down or go through us!" Jett said.  
"Haha you can try." one said pulling a pistol out of his satchel. Then raising the pistol up to Dash.  
His Father’s eyes widened finally he took a deep sigh and said "What do you want, because this isn't the way to get it."  
Then the outlaws spoke "You're right, this ain't the way...  you're the way."  
"You can get us gold can’t you? Or the kid goes by-by, your choice." the same man said. The man had a very strong accent, he must have been Boost the leader.  
"Fine, if you want gold why blow up the dam?" Jett said. Right then the man or girl-the girl was younger then the others-she raised the pistol and stopped at Jett.  
Dash raced over to his Dad and dove into him knocking him behind the speedcar as the bullet went past them.  
"Attack!!" one of the men shouted. The men and some women fought and fought and fought.  

But then someone in the trees blew the dam and all was lost.
