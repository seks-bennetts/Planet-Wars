"**AAAaaahhhhhh!!** Please don’t be a crash landing! PLEASE don’t Be A Crash Landing!!" she screamed as she flung through the area.  
"**IT'S GOING TO BE A CRASH LANDING!!!! AAAaaahhhhhhh!! Ooof!** *"Ooww, I’m getting used to that. Ouch ok. What did he say again? turn left at the big birch tree,"* she thought.  
She ran to the big birch tree, turned left and there it was. The tree fort looked more impressive than last time. They improved.  
"HEY! Flitttter!"  
Flitter looked around. "Oh hey,!"  
"Hey Flitter?" Mink said.  
"Yeah Mink?"  
"I need to tell you about something... or someone." Mink said.  
"OK, well tell me on the way." She said.
