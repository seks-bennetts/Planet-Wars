Sprout hopped off a branch and out of the tree. "**SPROOOOOOON!**" she shouted, "COME OOOOON!"  
"I’m coming," a soft voice said from a distance.  

"Daisy will be waiting for us" Sprout said impatiently. "UHG…" Sprout had an idea. "**RACE YOOOU!**", she screamed as loud as she could.  
"Don't be so loud, someone will hear us."  
"YOU DON’T KNOW THAT ANYMORE! Other planets don’t sneak onto other planets anymore now tha-" When she heard no answer, she pivoted toward where Sproon used to be.  She was gone.  
"Uhhh, Sproon? **SPROON?!** Did she go ahead? Yeah, yeah, she must have gone ahead...right?"  
... Aah!!  Then the only thing left there...was silence.
