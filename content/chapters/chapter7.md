"Oo oooh!" "This is gonna be the best day of my life! My liife!" a little girl sang jumping and rolling down a hill.  
"Oh! Ice cream stand!" she said.  
"Ice cream! Ice cream! Come get your ice cream!" said a big boomy voice.  
"Um sir? How much does this cost?" Carel asked.  
"Not too much for you. On the house." said the man.  
"?"... "thanks?"..."thanks!" Carel said, grabbing the ice cream.  
"Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay" screamed the girl running to her tree fort. She dove behind a tree trying to look secretive. She climbed up her secret ladder and into it.  
"Ok, who's hungry?"  
"Chirp! Gulp! Cricket!" The animals called.  
"Well, nice to know I at least have some friends."  
"Well, Iâ€™m going to go for a run, bye!"
"Qwerty, Grub, Mugl!"  
"Wee!!" She said hopping down from the treehouse, "Someday I'm gonna break an arm doing that!" And she ran right into the forest.
